# Visual Synthetic Monitoring

This is the official Alyvix GitHub repository.

Alyvix is a synthetic monitoring system based on computer vision. Alyvix synthesizes real users without being hardwired to application engines.

Alyvix automates any application, interacting with GUIs exactly as a human would do. Alyvix measures all transactions and
visualizes their performances in your monitoring system. Finally, Alyvix reports HTML pages containing the details of each test case step.

Alyvix certifies that users are able to successfully complete a certain application task, in a given moment and location, with a certain quality of service.
